# Circuits

Main circuit: `LOSTETHFOUND.circom`

Build notes (to run later):
1) Install circom + snarkjs, and circomlib
2) Run: `bun run zk:build`
3) Generated verifier lands at `contracts/Verifier.sol`
4) ZK artifacts are copied to `web/public/zk/` for the frontend

Build scripts live in `scripts/` now.
